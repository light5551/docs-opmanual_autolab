Requires: Passion for reproducible robotics

Results: Basic understanding of Autolabs

</div>


## Definition

The goal of an Autolab is to create a automated environment for Duckiebots, in which their behaviors can be evaluated.

### More specifically:

- If identical(*) hardware and software is used on 2 Duckiebots, the behavior should be reproducible in the same environment.
- the environment should be highly controlled and configurable

(*) identical to the best knowledge

### Applications:

- research benchmarking with the Duckietown platform
- physical evaluations for challenges of [AIDO](+AIDO#book)


## Autolab in action

The demo video shows:

- (00:00 ~ 00:31) An AIDO participant submitting to an AIDO challenge
- (00:32 ~ 03:14) Autolab evaluating the AIDO submission
- (03:15 ~      ) Evaluation experiment results and metrics presented on the AIDO website
