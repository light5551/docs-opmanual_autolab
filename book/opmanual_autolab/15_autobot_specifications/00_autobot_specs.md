### Prerequisite recommendation {#dt-env-developer nonumber notoc}

If you are building an Autolab, you are a committed developer of Duckietown. We strongly recommend using **Ubuntu 20.04**. To set up the computer, follow the instructions [here](+opmanual_duckiebot#laptop-setup).

We suggest that your workflow for software should follow the standard one, using [ `dt-env-developer` ](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-env-developer). This is a meta repository that aggregates, with the myrepos tool, the different repositories of code that developers use daily. To set it up, follow the [README instructions](https://github.com/duckietown/dt-env-developer). The rest of this book will assume that you set it up this way, but you could also clone each individual repository on its own and use it as usual.
